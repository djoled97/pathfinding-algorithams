This project presents pathfinding algorithms in action and it's visualization.
The application is designed to have three levels. The first level will have no obstacles and level after that will have an extra obstacle before reaching the goal. This will be repeated until we reach level 3.
# Setup
## Install dependencies
 ### `npm install`

## Run application



### `npm start`

The application will be started in dev mode on port 3000

# How to use
Before actually starting the visualization process of the application we need to set up some of the paramaters:<br>
- Setting the desired size of the grid or leave the default.
- Adding start and end node or use the predefined one.
- Choose the algorithm
<br>
<div><img  src="assets\p1.png" width=400  ><div>
<br/>

After we've setup this we can start the pathfinding using automatic or manual setup.<br>
If we choose to do it manually we start each pathfidning search by clicking on button **Start**. <br>
We can also choose to do it automatically where with one click on **Automatic** button we finish all the levels.<br>
At the end if want to see a replay of the animation we can do that by clicking the button **Replay**.
